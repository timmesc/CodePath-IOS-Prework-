App BrainStorm: 

1. Instagram
   - I admire the the explore page and its ability to display content that I am interested in.
   - I also admire the ability to archive posts that I may no longer want public, but still have.
     
2. Tik Tok
   - I greatly respect the tik tok shop. The app has created an all in one platform that can be used for marketing pruposes while also serving as an online shop.
   - I enjoy the simplicty of the app, for example the ability to repost a video is something I admire as I can share a video I like with my followers.
   - I also like the length of videos, much of my feed is educational and many topics such as new technology updates or nutrition facts can not be covered within a 15-30 second window.
     
3. Doordash
   - Doordash is one of my favorite apps because of the convience for businesses to reach customers they would not have, mainly because they can not afford to have full time delivery drivers. It also makes it much easier for people who may not have transportation to enjoy their favorite foods beacuse of its convience for business and consumer I truly enjoy the concept.
   - I also favor its feature to add specifics to an order allowing for an order to be crafted to perfection, the communcation the app has with consumer and business is a great feature.
     
4. Notion
   - Notion is one of my favorite planning app, a favorite feature of mine is to create sub-pages, I really enjoy this feature because it allows for a user to create a day plan with specifics hidden allowing for a much more organized interface.
   - I also enjoy the creative features as I can link many apps to my notion such as github.
  
  An app I would like to build is a grocery/food delivery app. The difference between apps such as doordash or instacart is that this app will serve the international market. I would like to bring international foods to people who may miss their traditional foods. A great example is my mother asking freinds of her to bring foods from Colombia when visiting. This app would work like doordash it would allow businesses to sell products on app and ship them to a customer. This elimnates a supply chain and serves as a wholesaler between business and customer. I would like to make the store front similar to ebay, allowing businesses to upload images of their product and consumers to purchase from a business based off image, price, description, and inventory. I would have filters for different regions and countries, allowing for simple navigation of the app to popular items or less well knwon items.
